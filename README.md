Hello, friends! I'm  **[Chad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juettner/))**.

Lotta folks use this space to talk about thier experience and how they're a *strategic thinker* and all sorts of nonsense. I'm actually kind of a dipshit. I've been doing all sorts of tech work for over a quarter-century and if anything I'm getting dumber.

That said, I have worked on some really cool projects. I've worked and consulted for some of the largest companies in the world and I've helped start companies from scratch. It's been a helluva career so far. I've still got some miles in me before I buy that bar up north.

That's it. Ni hao.
