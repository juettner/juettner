Hello, friends! I'm  **[Chad Juettner](https://chad.juettner.dev)**. I'm a software developer / consultant based out of Minneapolis, Minnesota. I've been doing all sorts of tech work for over a quarter-century.

That said, I have worked on some really cool projects. I've worked and consulted for some of the largest companies in the world and I've helped start companies from scratch. It's been a helluva career so far. I've still got some miles in me before I buy that bar up north.

Here's a picture of me and my dog, Otis. I met Otis at a divebar in Northeast Minneapolis after a Twins game. It's a great story. This was taken just a couple weeks after he joined the family. He still tries to carry sticks twice his size.
